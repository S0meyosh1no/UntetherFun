# UntetherFun
- this is not jailbreak at all!
# What this script do?
- Install patched TestFlight with FSUntether
- Automaticaly run nc, iproxy
- nothing else
# Not installing?
If TestFLight is not instaling it means cert has been revoked
If it has been revoked, message me in discord: @s0meyosh1no

# How to run?
```
chmod +x jb.sh && chmod +x helper.sh && jb.sh
```
# Not connecting?
Firts of all you need to open helper.sh in other bash session, and only after you have working helper you can run jb.sh

# Thanks
